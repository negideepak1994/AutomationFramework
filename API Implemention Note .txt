API Flow used in our sharepoint Project

@ On very first level we will Create a Page for API for example -  API Models ( where in we will define our Input Request and Response classes )

we will use quicktype.io to convert the json type into C# class types.


--> We will Read the API Header and Body Details from the CSV file ( ie Read Csv method will be automatically used)
--> And then we will assign the inputs reads from the csv file to the Class Object of Input Request class

--> Serialize input JSON request ---as String ( string InputJSONRequest - which is a serialized input data string)

--> Send the request(string InputJSONRequest) to HttpWebResponse method and get the HttpWebResponse Response 


--> convert the HttpWebResponse into String by Parse this Response(JSON Response) as String to get the ResponseString


Now Finally Parse the above responseString to Class Model Object [MO] ( so that we can use this response object to validate them Individually)

This will desearialize the JSON to the specefic .NET type
